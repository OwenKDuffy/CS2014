<h1>CS2014 2017 Assignment3 - Moar crypto, of the play-coin variety</h1>
<p>Your assignment is to write code that creates bitcoin-like values 
that meet the spec below and that are verified by 
the code you're given here. What we'll be doing is actually more
like a <a href="https://www.bitcoinmining.com/what-is-hashcash/">hashcash proof-of-work</a>
rather than anything to do with the bitcoin blockchain.</p>
<p>We'll re-use the <a href="https://tls.mbed.org/kb">mbed TLS</a>
package for the verifier code. You pretty much have to do the same for the coin making
code so that the automated assignment marking system works.
There are some hints below to which you ought pay attention.</p>
<h2>To setup a working environment...</h2>
<p>See <a href="../assignment2/README.html">assignment2</a>.</p>
<p>If you clone the course repo and this file is in <code>$REPO/assignments/assignment3</code>
then that directory contains a Makefile you can use. That Makefile assumes that 
you already built mbed TLS for assignment 2 and that the mbed TLS 
header files and library are below <code>$REPO/assignments/assignment2</code> - if you used 
some other directory structure you'll need to figure out what to change.</p>
<h2>"CS2014 COIN" Specification</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The basic idea is similar to, but a lot simpler than, the bitcoin idea of
mining <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty">"difficulty"</a>.  We require that
each "CS2014 coin" includes the inputs to a SHA256 hash whose output value has
a selected number of the low order (rightmost) bits with zero values. Since the
output of a hash funcion like SHA256 is essentially random, one has to try many
times before one sees such an output, and the longer the run of zeros required,
the more attempts one needs.</p>
<p>To generate such outputs we include a 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce">cryptographic nonce</a> in 
the hash input value. We can vary the nonce value until we find a hash output with the
required number of bits zero-valued. (Efficiency in coin mining is clearly
important, so please do try to make your code for this part as speedy as you
can!  Some marks may be available for that - ping me if you think you've
written some notably good code.)</p>
<p>In addition (just for the coding fun:-) we require each coin to be digitally
signed using the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) with the
p256 NIST curve. (That's the default when you generate an Elliptic Curve key
pair, so you won't need to understand any details of ECDSA:-) Our coins
therefore also include the public key needed to verify the coin signature in
the signed data. </p>
<p>There are also some housekeeping fields to help with encoding and
decoding and for (pretend:-) futureproofing. </p>
<p>CS2014 coins are binary values. We don't use JSON, XML or any other
generic data representation scheme.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Here's a hexdump of an example coin with 20 bits of difficulty: </p>

<h3>Protocol data units (PDUs)</h3>
<p>Our coin syntax is pretty simple, with all but one field being fixed width (for
now), and hence doesn't need us to use any data definition language such as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_Syntax_Notation_One">ASN.1</a>, 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_schema">XML schema</a> etc.</p>
<p>The fields in a CS2014 coin are: </p>
<table>
<tr><th>Offset</th><th>Name</th><th>Length</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>0</td><td>Ciphersuite</td><td>4</td><td>Specifies all cryptographic algorithms - value for now fixed at zero</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Bits</td><td>4</td><td>Specifies difficulty</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Public Key length</td><td>4</td><td>Specifies length of public key</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Public Key</td><td>158</td><td>Public key value (fixed for p256 curve)</td></tr>
<tr><td>170</td><td>Nonce len</td><td>4</td><td>length of nonce</td></tr>
<tr><td>174</td><td>Nonce</td><td>32</td><td>nonce used to generate PoW hash</td></tr>
<tr><td>206</td><td>PoW Hash len</td><td>4</td><td>length of proof-of-work hash</td></tr>
<tr><td>210</td><td>PoW Hash</td><td>32</td><td>proof-of-work hash</td></tr>
<tr><td>242</td><td>Signature len</td><td>4</td><td>length of coin self-signature</td></tr>
<tr><td>246</td><td>Signature</td><td>Variable (~138 octets)</td><td>coin self-signature</td></tr>
</table>

</table>

<p>The ciphersuite value of zero means: "use SHA256 for the proof-of-work and use
ECDSA with NIST p256 for the public key and signature." The ciphersuite concept
is used in TLS and various other cryptographic protocols.</p>
<p>All length fields and the bits field are in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_byte_order">network byte order</a>.</p>
<p>As a side-note: the public key and signature fields do actually internally use
ASN.1 specified encoding of those values encoded with the Distiguished Encoding
Rules (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distinguished_Encoding_Rules">DER</a>). 
That's done so that those are the same values used in 
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280">X.509 public key certificates</a>, 
as used for Transport Layer Security 
(<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246">TLS</a>), e.g.
when using 
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2818">HTTPS</a>. 
While we don't notice it here, that actually makes those values more complex
and bigger for no ostensibly good reason, if one didn't consider the savings 
in code re-use. Cases like that are common, and are one reason why it can 
take a very loooong time to migrate away from use of some pretty old 
format/API to any shiny new format/API. (See issues with 
<a href="https://cryptosense.com/why-pkcs1v1-5-encryption-should-be-put-out-of-our-misery/">PKCS#1v1.5</a>.)</p>
<h3>Cryptographic inputs/outputs</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bytes 0..205 inclusive are input to the Proof-of-Work (PoW) hash (which uses SHA256).</li>
<li>Bytes 206..241 inclusive are the PoW length and hash value</li>
<li>Bytes 0..241 inclusive are input to the signature </li>
<li>Bytes 242..end are the signature length and value</li>
</ul>

<h3>Some implementation requirements</h3>
<p>The specification above is basically a functional requrements specification
that says what your code must do. In addition, and as is common, we also 
have some implementation requirements that <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119">MUST</a> 
also be met:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your implementation MUST honour the existing API defined in <a href="./cs2014coin.h">cs2014coin.h</a></li>
<li>Your implementation MUST honour the existing command line arguments defined in <a href="./cs2014coin-main.c">cs2014coin-main.c</a></li>
<li>Coins produced by your implementation MUST be verifiable using the
  verification implementation you've been given. (That is, you cannot just
  change the verifier to win the game:-)</li>
<li>Your implementation of a coin miner SHOULD honour the CS2014COIN_MAXITERS value
defined in the API - that means your code ought exit with an error
if it doesn't find a coin after that number of iterations of nonce
values.</li>
<li>You SHOULD implement your coin miner in one .c file, it'd make sense to keep
using the <a href="./cs2014coin-make.c">cs2014coin-make.c</a> file and just add your code to that.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Some hints...</h3>
<p>Here's a few hints to help you with your mining code:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are examples in <code>$BUILD/mbedtls-2.6.0/programs/pkey/</code> that should 
  help you figure out how to use the mbed TLS APIs.
  (But you've a bunch of stuff to figure out too!)
  Don't only stare at that code - build, run and test it too.</li>
<li>mbed TLS functions you will likely want to use will include:<ul>
<li><code>mbedtls_ctr_drbg_seed</code></li>
<li><code>mbedtls_ecp_gen_key</code></li>
<li><code>mbedtls_md_starts</code></li>
<li><code>mbedtls_md_update</code></li>
<li><code>mbedtls_md_finish</code></li>
<li><code>mbedtls_pk_sign</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There are also various <code>mbedtls_*_init</code> and <code>mbedtls_*_setup</code> functions related to
  the above that you'll need to call to get those to work properly.</li>
<li>Using network byte order means calls to <code>htonl</code> and <code>ntohl</code> are needed,
  in case the miner's and verifier's machines have different endianness.</li>
<li>The <code>hexdump</code> (aka <code>hd</code>) tool will help you see what you're putting
  in files, e.g. to check if your lengths are or are not in network byte order.</li>
<li>Writing your code to test with a small value for "bits" (say 5) will help</li>
<li>Until your code seems to be working, limiting the iterations to a small 
  number (say 2) will help you debug your stuff </li>
<li>You'll likely need to debug with <code>gdb</code> for this one. We'll chat about
  that in class.</li>
<li>My working implementation of <code>cs2014coin-make.c</code> has 250 lines in the
  file, including comments and debugging code. Yours shouldn't be too much 
  different to that. </li>
<li>Understanding the verification code will help you write the mining
  code, so don't ignore that. You can run it and debug it using the
  sample coin.</li>
<li>Once you have a working coin miner, then you should be able to use
  the <a href="./check-timing.sh">check-timing.sh</a> shell script to see if 
  your performance, (in terms of iterations of attempted proof-of-work),
  is roughly similar to openssl's sha256 (in hashes per second) 
  on your development box. They should be close - less than an order 
  of magnitude apart.</li>
</ul>
<h2>A typedef for our coins...</h2>
<p>The <a href="./cs2014coin.h">cs2014coin.h</a> header file defines the API you
have to use, and includes the  <code>typedef struct</code> below. You
can, but don't have to use that in your code. (There are no copies
of, or pointers to, instances of that structure passed in the API,
so you don't have to use it.)</p>
<p>But we'll look at it now anyway...</p>
<pre><code>    /*!
     * @brief our basic cs2094 coin type
     * 
     * This structure describes a cs2014 coin.
     * Fields are flattened as usual, lengths use network byte order.
     * The hash is over the fields that preceed it in the struct.
     * The rightmost 'bits' bits of the hash value must be zero.
     * The signature is over the fields that proceed it in the struct.
     * All length fields, except 'bits' are in octets
     *
     */
    typedef struct cs2014coin_t_defn {
        int ciphersuite; /// specifies all algorithms 
        int bits; /// specifies the zero-bit run length needed in the hashval
        int keylen; /// length of the public key
        unsigned char *keyval; /// public key value
        int noncelen; /// length of nonce
        unsigned char *nonceval;
        int hashlen; /// length of hashval
        unsigned char *hashval; /// hash value with 'bits' of the LSBs having a value of zero 
        int siglen; /// signature length
        unsigned char *sigval; /// signature value
    } cs2014coin_t;
</code></pre>
<p>If I wanted to use that in some code, then I'd declare a variable
<code>foo</code> like this:</p>
<pre><code>    cs2014coin_t mycoin;
</code></pre>
<p>And I can access (read/set) the field values like this:</p>
<pre><code>    mycoin.ciphesuite==CS2014COIN_CS_0;
</code></pre>
<p>When I declare such a variable on the stack it'll consume a pile
of memory ( 6 ints and 4 pointers, so maybe ~48 bytes total or
more if the compiler aligns things specially).
But your code may be a good bit tidier if you use such a variable
rather than have a load of separate variables (which won't really
be much more memory efficient in many cases). And tidier
code is easier to maintain etc. which is a good thing (tm). </p>
<p>If I wanted to pass a value like mycoin (say after it's been
fully populated) to some function, <code>print_coin()</code> then I
might declare that function like this:</p>
<pre><code>    void print_coin (cs2014coin_t coin);
</code></pre>
<p>To call that with mycoin as an input I just pass the variable to the function
follows:</p>
<pre><code>    print_coin(mycoin);
</code></pre>
<p>That's a little inefficient as the full structure is passed
on the stack. So we much more commonly pass a pointer to
the structure and hence would have a function like this 
instead:</p>
<pre><code>    void print_coin (cs2014coin_t *coin);
</code></pre>
<p>Now there's only one pointer passed on the stack which is
better, for large structs. To call that with mycoin as an
input I need to pass the address of mycoin and not the 
value of mycoin, which I do using the &amp; character as
follows:</p>
<pre><code>    print_coin(&amp;mycoin);
</code></pre>
<p>Inside that function, to access (read/set) the values of
the fields we might have code like:</p>
<pre><code>    if (coin-&gt;ciphersuite==CS2014COIN_CS_0) {
        printf("Default Cipersuite\n");
    }
</code></pre>
<p>There's also an <em>important</em> difference in passing
things or pointers to things to functions. Since
C passes everything <em>by value</em>, you have to 
pass a pointer to that thing if the function
you're calling
needs to modify the value of an input.
(To make a parameter an in/out parameter in 
e.g. doxygen terms.)</p>
<p>I like <a href="https://denniskubes.com/2012/08/20/is-c-pass-by-value-or-reference/">this</a>
description of how C does pass by value.</p>
<p>But again, you might or might not want to use
this particular struct in doing assignment 3, I mainly
included it to have this discussion of <em>pass
by value</em> and <em>pass by reference</em>.</p>

<p>There are a number of notewothy things in the code given to you for this assignment:</p>
<ul>
<li>We've seen our first use of an <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119">RFC2119</a> MUST</li>
<li>We've used <code>extern</code> in the internal API stuff for error strings.</li>
<li>We use <code>getopt()</code> - for details see <code>man 3 getopt</code> 
  Do also look at this <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Example-of-Getopt.html">example</a></li>
<li>The verification <a href="./cs2014coin-check.c">code</a> attempts to be 
<a href="https://cryptocoding.net/index.php/Coding_rules">constant time</a>. 
That code is nearly, but not quite, done - anyone interested in improving
that is welcome to try and I'll be interested in what you find. (I
might do a bit more on that myself as I need to learn how to do
sometime:-)</li>
<li><code>dumpbuf()</code> etc is handy and fairly typical</li>
<li>Things like <code>cs2014coin-int.h</code> and <code>cs2014coin-util.c</code> are typical too.</li>
<li>Error string handling like this is sorta-but-not-that common</li>
<li>The doxygen docs for this could be interesting to look at, see if
  you can make them?</li>
<li>I'd have preferred to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdDSA">EdDSA</a>,
  and in particular <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8032">Ed25519</a>, 
  for this, or at least 
  <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6979">deterministic signatures</a>, 
  but that'd have made this too hard an assignment.
  The reason is that ECDSA signature generation requires a random
  number, and if that's badly chosen, then the private signing
  key can leak (invalidating the entire point of signing). Such
  details are often not easily visible to you as a programmer, but can be
  critically important for the overall system produced. (The point
  here is about security, but similar issues arise for any 
  emergent property of the system, such as performance or
  usability.)</li>
