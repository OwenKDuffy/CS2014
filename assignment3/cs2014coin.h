 * @brief our basic cs2094 coin type
 *
 * This structure describes a cs2014 coin.
 * Fields are flattened as usual, lengths use network byte order.
 * The hash is over the fields that preceed it in the struct.
 * The rightmost 'bits' bits of the hash value must be zero.
 * The signature is over the fields that proceed it in the struct.
 * All length fields, except 'bits' are in octets
